  METHOD 2 (Rotate one by one)
  ----------------------------

    leftRotate(arr[], d, n)
    start
    For i = 0 to i < d
        Left rotate all elements of arr[] by one
    end

    To rotate by one, store arr[0] in a temporary variable temp,
        move arr[1] to arr[0], arr[2] to arr[1] â€¦and finally temp to arr[n-1]
            Let us take the same example arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d = 2
            Rotate arr[] by one 2 times
            We get [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1] after first rotation and
            [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2] after second rotation.
